FIFA21 Dataset Analysis

In this data analysis project, I explored the FIFA dataset, which contains valuable information about soccer players from the popular FIFA video game. The dataset includes various attributes such as player attributes (e.g., age, overall rating, potential), physical characteristics (e.g., height, weight), positions, and player salaries.

The main objectives of this project were to gain insights into the dataset, understand player distributions based on age, overall rating, and salary, and explore the relationship between player attributes and their positions. I used Python programming language and popular libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

The key steps in the analysis included data cleaning to handle missing values, converting appropriate data types, and filtering out relevant information for the analysis. I performed data visualization using bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots to present meaningful insights effectively.

Additionally, I randomly selected 10 players' salaries to showcase in a bar chart, highlighting their earnings in a visually appealing manner.

Overall, this project provided a valuable opportunity to work with real-world data, utilize essential data analysis techniques, and present the findings in an engaging and informative way through data visualization. By conducting this analysis, I deepened my understanding of soccer player data, improved my data analysis skills, and further enriched my data science portfolio.
